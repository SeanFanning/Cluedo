# Cluedo

The game is played firstly by selecting how many players will be playing. After, players take turns moving across 
the board and forming hypothesies. 
You must be in a room to form a hypothesis and once you do your turn ends.
Every bit of information is detailed in the player's notebook which you can access by pressing "4" once the game starts
and it is your turn. You can filter the notebook by typing in keywords that are relevant to the game. For example, if you
wanted to see every thing related to hypothesis you just need to type in "hypothesis".
You can make an accusation however if you get it wrong you are out of the game entirely, if you are right game ends.
Players characters are selected at random.

We hope you enjoy our game!
